Hereâ€™s a README.md for the hybrid scraper project:

Hybrid LLM Scraper Project

The Hybrid LLM Scraper is a versatile scraping framework designed to extract data from static, dynamic, and API-based sources. Additionally, it leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to process, summarize, and analyze the scraped content, making it suitable for advanced use cases like content curation, data aggregation, and machine learning pipelines.

Features
	â€¢	Static Scraping:
	â€¢	Scrape data from static web pages using tools like requests and BeautifulSoup.
	â€¢	Dynamic Scraping:
	â€¢	Handle JavaScript-rendered content using tools like Selenium or Playwright.
	â€¢	API-Based Scraping:
	â€¢	Fetch structured data from APIs with configurable query parameters.
	â€¢	LLM Integration:
	â€¢	Summarize or analyze content using pre-trained models such as OpenAI GPT or Hugging Face Transformers.
	â€¢	Data Pipeline:
	â€¢	Process, validate, and transform raw data into meaningful insights.
	â€¢	Monitoring:
	â€¢	Track scraping performance and monitor errors using customizable metrics.
